    "Kansas City, despite its name, sits on the border of two US states: Missouri and Kansas. The Kansas City metropolitan area consists of 15 counties, 9 in Missouri and 6 in Kansas. The entire state of Kansas has 105 counties and Missouri has 114. Use Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the probability that a relative who just moved to a county in the Kansas City metropolitan area also lives in a county in Kansas. Make sure to show P(Kansas) assuming your relative either lives in Kansas or Missouri), P(Kansas City metropolitan area), and P(Kansas City Metropolitan area | Kansas). \n",
