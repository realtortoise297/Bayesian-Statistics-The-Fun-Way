    "Every time you and your friend get together to watch movies, you flip a coin to determine who gets to choose the movie. Your friend always picks heads, and every Friday for 10 weeks, the coin lands on heads. You develop a hypothesis that the coin has two heads sides, rather than both a heads side and a tails side. Set up a Bayes factor for the hypothesis that the coin is a trick coin over the hypothesis that the coin is fair. What does this ratio alone suggest about whether or not your friend is cheating you? \n",
